# Instructor's repository

This repository contains several CLion C++ projects created by the instructor for the course.
Code related to assignment solutions will be posted here as well.

Contents:
1. [cmake_base_project](cmake_base_project): base template of a CLion C++ project. It can be copied/pasted as a new project. Don't forget to change the project name in the scripts (*.sh and CMakeLists.txt).
2. [cpp_intro1](cpp_intro1): project that illustrates the basic features of C++ (variables, types, functions, pointers, etc.).
3. [cpp_oo_intro](cpp_oo_intro): project that illustrates the object-oriented features of C++ (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.).
4. [memory_mgnt](memory_mgnt): small program used to illustrate how variables are created in the memory Stack and Heap (see the corresponding lecture about it).
5. [libclient](libclient): base code for assignment #2. I illustrates how to use libraries in a C++ program.
6. [next_date](next_date): the instructor's next date program.
7. [figures](figures): the instructor's figure printing program.
